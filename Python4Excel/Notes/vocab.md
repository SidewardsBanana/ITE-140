ORM
# ORM stands for Object-relational Mapper Software

# In 1995, the first successful ORM framework that was commercially available was published. This framework was called TOPLink, a product by Smalltalk

# In 1996 a Java version of TopLink was added and was called TopLink for Java

# In 1997 the first company to buy TopLink for Java was 3M

# ORM can be seen as a layer that connects object-oriented programs (OOP) to relational databases

# An ORM tool is software that is meant to help OOP developers interact with relational databases
